- Connecting Services to Deployments
- Note the Service selector allow access to the deployment at BOTH the Deployment level AND the Pod level - i.e. the Sevice is attached to all Deployment of nginx, which have a 1 or more Pod/s in it! Only then it is applied (This is the reason for the metadata labels and selector)

- Note: The Deployment is the Internal port that 'nginx' is exposing whereas the Service maps the external access port (a la 80) and maps this to the containerPort (Deploy/Serv are 8080)
