- # kubectl
- **CRUD**
	- kubctl create deployment [name]
	- kubctl edit deployment [name]    (editing config live in memory)
	- kubctl delete deployment [name]
- **Status of components**
	- kubctl get nodes | pod | services | replicaset | deployment
- **Debugging pods**
	- kubctl logs [pod name]
	- kubctl exec -it [pod name] -- bin/bash
	- kubctl describe pod [pod name]
- **Config file**
	- kubctl apply -f [file name]
	- kubctl delete -f [file name]
- # YAML config for K8s
- **3 parts of config file**
	- 1. metadata
	  2. specification  (deployment then lower level for pod)
	  3. status - automatically generated so not part of yaml definition file  (actual vs. desired state)
	  Contingent as to which "spec" (kind: Deployment OR Service)is being created **spec** structure is different! 
	                           (Note for Deployment then apiVersion: apps/v1 whereas Service is apiVersion: v1)
	- Layers of Abstraction
		- **Deployment** manages a ...
		- **ReplicaSet** manages a  ...
		- **Pod** is an abstraction of ...
		- **Container**

	  apiVersion: apps/v1
	  kind: Deployment
	  metadata:
	    name: nginx-deployment
	    labels:
	      app: nginx
	  spec:         # Deployment
	    replicas: 1
	    selector:
	      matchLabels:

	      spec:             # pod
	        containers:
	        - name: nginx
	          image: nginx:1.20.2
	          ports:
	          - containerPort: 80
	  ```
		- Note the Deployment vs Pod ---> the recursive of "metadata" [3-6] and "spec" [13-15] data!
		- **Blueprint** [16-21]
- # Labels & Selectors
- ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
