- # Docker networks
- These are: bridge / hosts  / mac-vlan
- Bridge: is the connection via the default bridge ---> so better to define your own network (User-defined bridge
	- ```
	  sudo docker network create mybridge
	  4f6354fdf208b37ee919fcb184b8e040e2ba974d445e9f744a9cb2609bc049b2
	  docker network ls       # --->
	  NETWORK ID     NAME       DRIVER    SCOPE
	  9ce45ca2c596  bridge       bridge     local
	  adb4bbc8b63a host           host        local
	  4f6354fdf208    mybridge  bridge    local
	  8cfb809909bd  none          null         local
	  
	  # Note: all containers will belong to default host (IP range of 172.17.0.2) unless defined against new network
	  e.g. 
	  sudo docker run -itd --rm --network mybridge --name bbox busybox
	  	# ---> results in 172.18.0.1 for bbox - which is an isolated network from the default
	      
	  	# Note: if bbox was a webserver then the netwotk post must be exposed
	  e.g.
	  sudo docker run -itd --rm -p 8080:80 --name mynginx nginx
	  5aeb64da99f7a853436ea1cea413f34e059bc81e71111e6c18e292727d090fc7
	     # ---> In browser 192.168.1.106:8080 results in nginx webser defaults
	  
	  ```
- Host: These are defined against your own network and leverage your current IP address (your PC)
	- ```
	  sudo docker run -itd --rm --network host  --name mynginx nginx
	  c92b61ff73ecf908753dbebb4870cbd284f133eec7aaae85a0d6e064971039b2
	  
	  # go to browser and connect to IP Address of nginx and is will be like any other app - it is still a container on host
	  # e.g. wireguard can be run on host without the virtual IP address as another app
	  ```
- mac-vlan:
	- ```
	  sudo docker network create -d macvlan --subnet 192.168.1.1/24 --gateway 192.168.1.1 -o parent=enp1s0f0 newmynetwork #name of network
	      # get this - enp1s0f0 - from: ip address show AND look the host ref
	  c92b61ff73ecf908753dbebb4870cbd284f133eec7aaae85a0d6e064971039b2
	  
	  # go to browser and connect to P Address of nginx and is will be like any other spp in the PC host
	  ```
