- # Docker networks
- These are: bridge / hosts  / mac-vlan
- Bridge: is the connection via the default bridge ---> so better to define your own network (User-defined bridge
	- ```
	  sudo docker network create mybridge
	  4f6354fdf208b37ee919fcb184b8e040e2ba974d445e9f744a9cb2609bc049b2
	  docker network ls       # --->
	  NETWORK ID     NAME       DRIVER    SCOPE
	  9ce45ca2c596  bridge       bridge     local
	  adb4bbc8b63a host           host        local
	  4f6354fdf208    mybridge  bridge    local
	  8cfb809909bd  none          null         local
	  
	  # Note: all containers will belong to default host (IP range of 172.17.0.2) unless defined against new network
	  e.g. 
	  sudo docker run -itd --rm --network mybridge --name bbox busybox
	  	# ---> results in 172.18.0.1 for bbox - which is an isolated network from the default
	      
	  	# Note: if bbox was a webserver then the netwotk post must be exposed
	  e.g.
	  
	  ```
- Host: These are defined against your own network and leverage your current IP address (your PC)
