- ### Node Components
- Container runtime   ---> The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.
- kubelet   ---> An agent that runs on each [node(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) in the cluster. It makes sure that [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/) are running in a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).
- kubeproxy
- ### Control Plane Componenets
- kube-apiserver     --->The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.
- etcd   ---> Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
- kube-scheduler   ---> Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.

- # Volumes
- ephemeral (this are trasient and are deleted - whether a) at a container level or b) pod level or c) at the node level)
- persistent volumes (such as AWs / GCP / Azure etc) ensure the data is permanent
-
- 3 variations for persistent data
	- Persistent Volumes
	- Persistent Volume Claims
	- Storage Classes
- definition Kind: Persistent Volume
