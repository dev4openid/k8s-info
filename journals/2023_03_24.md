	- ```
	  minikube start -n=3
	  ```

- # Services
- container does not expose its ports to the cluster's network, and it is not discoverable either
- [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), and it is the recommended method to expose any containerized application to the Kubernetes network
# Authentication, Authorization, and Admission Control
- **Authentication** Authenticate a user based on credentials provided as part of API requests.
- **Authorization** Authorizes the API requests submitted by the authenticated user.
- **Admission Control** Software modules that validate and/or modify user requests.

- **Controlling Access to the API**
- (Retrieved from [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/controlling-access/))
- # Authentication
- Kubernetes supports two kinds of [users](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#users-in-kubernetes):
- **Normal Users**
  They are managed outside of the Kubernetes cluster via independent services like User/Client Certificates, a file listing usernames/passwords, Google accounts, etc.
- **Service Accounts**
  Service Accounts allow in-cluster processes to communicate with the API server to perform various operations. Most of the Service Accounts are created automatically via the API server, but they can also be created manually. The Service Accounts are tied to a particular Namespace and mount the respective credentials to communicate with the API server as Secrets
- [authentication modules](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies):
- **X509 Client Certificates**
	- **--client-ca-file=SOMEFILE**
- **Static Token File**
	- **--token-auth-file=SOMEFILE**
- **Bootstrap Tokens**
	- Tokens used for bootstrapping new Kubernetes clusters
- **Service Account Tokens**
	- Automatically enabled authenticators - allows in-cluster processes to talk to the API server
- **OpenID Connect Tokens**
	- OpenID Connect helps us connect with OAuth2 providers, such as Azure Active Directory, Salesforce, and Google, to offload the authentication to external services
- **Webhook Token Authentication**
	- verification of bearer tokens can be offloaded to a remote service
- **Authenticating Proxy**
	- Allows for the programming of additional authentication logic
	-
- # Authorization
	- API request attributes that are reviewed by Kubernetes include user, group, Resource, Namespace, or API group, to name a few.
	- Authorization has multiple modules, or authorizers
	- **Node** Node authorization is a special-purpose authorization mode which specifically authorizes API requests made by kubelets. It authorizes the kubelet's read operations for services, endpoints, or nodes, and writes operations for nodes, pods, and events
