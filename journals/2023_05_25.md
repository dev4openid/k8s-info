- ## Backup To Remote Server
  
  This command will copy, compress and send the image to the remote server.
  
  dd if=/dev/sdb | gzip -c –-fast | ssh user@ip ‘dd of=/home/user/sdb.img.gz’
  
  dd= if=/dev/sda | gzip -c --fast
- Explanation: DD has been instructed to copy the drive /dev/sdb. Gzip will be used for compression, **- c** means Write on standard output, keep original files unchanged, **- -fast** mean Compress faster at the expense of high compression ration. The image will then be transferred via OpenSSH using the provided user credentials to the user directory */home/user*. Note: the backup image makes use of the **.gz** extension to indicate compression is being used.

Restoring the image is not that different from the command used to backup the image.

ssh user@ip ‘dd if=/home/user/sdb.img.gz’ | gunzip -1 - | dd of=/dev/sdb

Explanation: Using OpenSSH log in to the remote system where the image is stored and with DD pull the image. **Gunzip** will be used to decompress the image crated by Gzip. Once again DD will be in charged of writing the image to /dev/sdb.
