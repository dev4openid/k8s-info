- ==Note==
	- To connect intra-Pod then the other Pod referencing is used - e.g. mysql-connect("db-service.dev.svc.cluster.local")   - for another Pod in the local cluster with the name: dev # obviously the user is defined and authenticated with permissions to access other Pod
		- db-service.dev.svc.cluster.local ==> ServiceName.Namespace.Service.domain
			- cluster.local   = domain
			- Services = svc
			- Namespace = dev
			- Service Name = db-service
	- Intra-cluster pos connections is a different challenge
	- ResourceQuotas are applicable to a given namespace and constrains the overall pods & request/limits for cpu/mem in a given namespace
