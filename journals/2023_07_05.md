- Check `vi ~/.kube/config`
- To add a new user:
	- ```
	  #create a user key: 
	  openssl genrsa -out briand.key
	  # --> briand.key
	  
	  # create a user csr cert
	  openssl req -new -key briand.key -out briand.csr -subj "/CN=briand/O=dev/O=example.org"
	  # ---> briand.csr
	  
	  # get signed by minikube the crt (token)
	  openssl  x509 -req -CA ~/.minikube/ca.crt -CAkey ~/.minikube/ca.key -CAcreateserial -days 750 -in briand.csr -out briand.crt
	  Certificate request self-signature ok
	  subject=CN = briand, O = dev, O = example.org
	  # brian.crt created
	  
	  # ---> briand.crt # add user to cluster
	  kubectl config set-credentials briand --client-certificate=briand.crt --client-key=briand.key
	  User "briand" set
	  # briand user is set in minkube config
	  
	  # check for user briand
	  # using vi ~/.kube/config results in:
	  	# - name: briand
	  	#     user:
	  	#       client-certificate: /home/briandanks/gdrive_local/Learning/Learn_Kubernetes/k8s-training/Kubernetes-master/resources/rbac/briand.crt
	  	#       client-key: /home/briandanks/gdrive_local/Learning/Learn_Kubernetes/k8s-training/Kubernetes-master/resources/rbac/briand.key
	  # look for new user briand
	  
	  # provide a context of briand-minikube (briand into minikube)
	  kubectl config set-context briand-minikube --cluster=minikube --user=briand --namespace=default
	  Context "briand-minikube" created.
	  # using vi ~/.kube/config results in:
	  	#- context:
	  	#    cluster: minikube
	  	#    namespace: default
	  	#    user: briand
	  	#  name: briand-minikube
	  
	  # a check:
	  kubectl config get-contexts
	  CURRENT   NAME              CLUSTER    AUTHINFO   NAMESPACE
	            briand-minikube   minikube   briand     default
	  *         minikube          minikube   minikube   default
	  
	  # kubectl config use-context briand-minikube  # to set the context of the cluster
	  
	  # now the user briand is a valid user AND nothing else
	  ```
	-
- To define a role for a new user
	- ```
	  # as per the role.yaml the
	  # verbs: [""@get", "watch", "list"] #limit the access/actions for a user
	  # from: 
	  kubectl api-resources -o wide | rg pod
	  # result in create,delete,deletecollection,get,list,patch,update,watch choices
	  
	  kubectl apply -f role.yaml
	  role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-reader created
	  # check
	  kubectl get roles
	  NAME         CREATED AT
	  pod-reader   2023-07-05T12:10:35Z
	  # user role is now defined
	  ```
- To define the rolebinding (when the user, has a role defined)
	- ```
	  # as per the role-binding.yaml
	  kubectl apply -f role-binding.yaml
	  rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/read-pods created
	  # user can now read-pods ["get", "watch", "list"]
	  
	  kubectl config use-context briand-minikube
	  Switched to context "briand-minikube".
	  
	  # now get pods
	  kubectl get pods
	  # see nginx running
	  
	  kubectl config use-context minikube
	  
	  # new namespace created
	  kubectl create ns test             
	  namespace/test created
	  
	  kubectl  run nginx --image=nginx -n test
	  pod/nginx created
	  
	  config use-context briand-minikube
	  Switched to context "briand-minikube".
	  
	  # Note: the rolebing id limited to the appropriate namespace ---> kubectl get pod -n test will not be found
	  
	  
	  ```
- Note: Role and RoleBinding is always limited to a namespace
- To get around this leverage cluster level means all resources in all namespaces are visible
- ```
  # Leverage the cluster rolebinding # cluster-role.yaml AND cluster-role-binding.yaml
  kubectl config use-context minikube
  Switched to context "minikube".
  
  # create cluster role
  kubectl apply -f cluster-role.yaml
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-reader created
  # followed by cluster-role-binding
  apply -f cluster-role-binding.yaml
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-reader-global created
  
  apply -f cluster-role-binding.yaml
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-reader-global created
  
  kubectl get pod -n test
  NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  nginx   1/1     Running   0          12m
  # Note: the namespace test pods are now visible as cluster role and role binding  Carefull!!
  # This now the case that briand is the same as default admin rights (in context to permissions)
  ```
- For all users:
- Note: the openssl creta csr we nominated briand to be member of O=dev (which is a group) and the group dev is in the cluster-role-binding.yaml the anyone belonging to group O=dev can inherit permissions
-
- ### Service accounts
- Every namespace created has a service-account
