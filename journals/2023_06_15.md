- # Reflect Deployment AND/OR Service
- `kubectl describe service nginx-service`
- `kubectl describe deployment nginx-deploy`
- this reconciles with the source yaml files.   Check this out!
-
- AND use `kubectl get pod -o wide` to reconcile the S is attched to the correct Pod IPs
- NOTE: By deleting the source file the deployment/service is "removed"
	- `kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml`
	- `kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yaml`
	- Note: be careful as this is not production method as in production all sources are in git!
