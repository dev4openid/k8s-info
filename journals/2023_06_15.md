- ### Blueprint for Pods (Templates)
- ==Structure of yaml file:==
	- ```yaml
	  apiVersion:
	  kind:
	  metadata:
	  spec:
	  ```
- *==Tip:==*
	- use `kubectl api-resources | grep deployment`  ---> (or service /  secret / configmap / pods)
- ### Connecting components (labels, selectors and ports)

- Connecting Services to Deployments
- Note the Service selector allow access to the deployment at BOTH the Deployment level AND the Pod level - i.e. the Sevice is attached to all Deployment of nginx, which have a 1 or more Pod/s in it! Only then it is applied (This is the reason for the metadata labels and selector)
- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686906061887_0.png)
- Note: The Deployment is the Internal port that 'nginx' is exposing whereas the Service maps the external access port (a la 80) and maps this to the containerPort (Deploy/Serv are 8080)
-
- # Reflect Deployment AND/OR Service
- `kubectl describe service nginx-service`
- `kubectl describe deployment nginx-deploy`
- this reconciles with the source yaml files.   Check this out!
-
- AND use `kubectl get pod -o wide` to reconcile the S is attched to the correct Pod IPs
- AND use `kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml` to look at the deployment in yaml format - as below: ---> Note this is returned from etcd
	- ![View of deployment](/home/briandanks/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2023-06-16 11-22-42.png) /
	- View of deployment
- NOTE: By deleting the source file the deployment/service is "removed"
	- `kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml`
	- `kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yaml`
	- Note: be careful as this is not production method as in production all sources are in git!
