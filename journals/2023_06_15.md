- # Reflect Deployment AND/OR Service
- `kubectl describe service nginx-service`
- `kubectl describe deployment nginx-deploy`
- this reconciles with the source yaml files.   Check this out!
-
- AND use `kubectl get pod -o wide` to reconcile the S is attched to the correct Pod IPs
- AND use `kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml` to look at the deployment in yaml format - as below: ---> Note this is returned from etcd
	- ![View of deployment](/home/briandanks/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2023-06-16 11-22-42.png) /
	- View of deployment
- NOTE: By deleting the source file the deployment/service is "removed"
	- `kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml`
	- `kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yaml`
	- Note: be careful as this is not production method as in production all sources are in git!
