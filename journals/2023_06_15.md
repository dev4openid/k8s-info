- # Kubernetes (Nana)
- minikube start / stop / delete / status
- minikube dashboard (overview of env and can do more! - more later)
- example `minikube start --namespace=learn --disk-size='5gb' --driver=docker`  --> careful here on what thew driver facilitates irt services!! e.g. quemu or quemu2
	- the input allow options such as namespave, disk alloc, driver to be use, etc.   `minikube start --help`
- `minikube status`
	- result are similar to:
	- minikube
	  type: Control Plane
	  host: Running
	  kubelet: Running
	  apiserver: Running
	  kubeconfig: Configured

- ## kubectl
- `kubectl version`
- create deployment
	- `kubectl create deployment nginx-depl --image=nginx` -- image can be versioned to nginx:1.16 as e.g.
	- with the result of a pod instance`
- `kubectl get deployment`
	- NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
	  nginx-depl   1/1          1                     1                    19s
- `kubectl get pod`
	- NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
	  nginx-depl-56cb8b6d7-pwlmz   1/1         Running    0                  34m
- `kubectl exec -it nginx-depl-56cb8b6d7-pwlmz -- bin/bash`
	- root@nginx-depl-56cb8b6d7-pwlmz:/#   ---> this allows root control of pod itself
- `kubectl edit deployment`
	- `0 # Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
	    1 # and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
	    2 # reopened with the relevant failures.

- Note: the kubectl deployment can be manipulated by:
	- `kubectl create deployment ...`
	- `kubectl edit deployment ...`
	- `kubectl delete deployment ...`
	-
- `kubectl get replicaset`

- Note: By editing the deployment replicasets, other configs realising in the outcome desired
	-
- `kubectl apply -f config-file.yaml`
	- deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
	  deployment.apps/nginx-deployment configured
	- Note the difference above - 1 to create and 1 to change the config
-
- Summary:  (01:01:43)
	- Status of different K8s components:
		- kubectl get nodes | service | replicaset | deployment
	- Debugging pods:
		- log to console ---> `kubectl logs nginx-deployment-68d9b6c666-ksx2w` [pod name]
-
- ## Creating as yaml file
- Firstly there is always a Deployment and a Service yaml file (Need both)
	- Deployment to define what is to be instantiated
	- Service is to define how the Deployment is to be accessed
- ![image.png](../assets/image_1686861013734_0.png)
- 3 parts!
	- 1. metadata
	  2. specification
	  3. status (automatically generated on instatiation by k8s)
- Note all status is found in etcd
