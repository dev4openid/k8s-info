- # Ingress Default Backend
- ```
  kubectl describe ingress dashboard-ingress -n kubernetes-dashboard
  
  # some output !!!!!
  # Note: in output the Default backend: is by default mapped to default-http-backend:80
  
  ```

- Multiple ingress use cases:
	- Multiple paths for same host
		- ```
		  # examples of many paths
		  http: 
		    paths:
		    - path: /analytics
		      backend: 
		        serviceName: analytics-dashboard  # to map in dashboard service!!
		        servicePort: 80
		    - path: /shopping
		      backend: 
		        serviceName: kubernetes-dashboard  # to map in dashboard service!!
		        servicePort: 80
		  ```
	- Multiple sub-domains or domains
	- where instead of http://myapp.com/analytics the http://analytics.myapp.com is preferred
		- ```
		  spec:       # routing rules - forward external request to the internal service
		    rules:
		    - host: analytics.myapp.com
		      http: 
		        paths:
		          backend: 
		            serviceName: analytics-service
		            servicePort: 3000
		    - host: shopping.myapp.com
		      http: 
		        paths:
		          backend: 
		            serviceName: shopping-service
