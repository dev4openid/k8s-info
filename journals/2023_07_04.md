- # Stateful Service (STS)
- each pod will connect to it's own PVC and PV
- but service is NOT LoadBalancer but None (i.e. a Headless Service)
- all pods are ordered pods with sticky ID (to ensure consistency and allow slaves/master to find each other for replication)
- only master is read/write - slaves are read only
- if the ordered sequence of pods has a problem with any node the the process stops and no further
