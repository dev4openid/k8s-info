- # Stateful Service (STS)
- each pod will connect to it's own PVC and PV
- but service is NOT LoadBalancer but None (i.e. a Headless Service) ---> clusterIP: None
- all pods are ordered pods with sticky ID (to ensure consistency and allow slaves/master to find each other for replication)
- only master is read/write - slaves are read only
- if the ordered sequence of pods has a problem with any node the the process stops and no further pods are initiated (sequence dependency in the order)
- e.g.
	- mongodb-0.mongodb-svc.default.svc.cluster.local:27017   (coreDNS reference)
		- Note:
			- mongodb-0 is the pod name plus a -increment (e.g. -0 and so forth)
			- mongodb-svc is the service name
			- default is the minikube default or could be any namespace

- Deployment vs. Statefulset
- The pods are now sequence BUT need to set up replicaset to ensure data is consistent from master to slaves
	- `kubectl exec -it mongo-0 -- mongo`
	- then in mongo at prompt execute
		- ```
		  rs.initiate(
		  	{
		      _id:"rs0",	# rs0 is the replicaset name
		        members: [
		          {_id:0, host : "mongo-0.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local:27017"},
		          {_id:0, host : "mongo-1.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local:27017"},
		          {_id:0, host : "mongo-2.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local:27017"}
		        ]
		      }
		  )
		  ```
		- then exit and reenter, look for `rs.status()`and check the prompt is rs0:PRIMARY (this can be checked for rs1:SECONDARY or rs2 :SECONDARY)
		- goto `kubectl exec -it mongo-1 -- mongo` and execute `rs.slaveOk()`to invoke the sync of data from master to slaves
