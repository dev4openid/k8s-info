- **Starting and defining minikube**
- e.g.
- ```minikube start --nodes=2 --driver=docker --kubernetes-version=1.29.1 --container-runtime=cri-o --profile minidock
- ```
-
- **Methods to access a Kubernetes cluster.**
	- kubectl
	- Dashboard
	- via APIs
- **Note**
	- minikube is to create cluster, nodes, etc with definition
	- kubectl is to access the cluster
- The main component of the Kubernetes control plane is the **API Server**, responsible for exposing the Kubernetes APIs. The APIs allow operators and users to directly interact with the cluster. Using both CLI tools and the Dashboard UI, we can access the API server running on the control plane node to perform various operations to modify the cluster's state. The API Server is accessible through its endpoints by agents and users possessing the required credentials.
- Below, we can see the representation of the HTTP API directory tree of Kubernetes:

- **HTTP API Directory Tree of Kubernetes**
- HTTP API directory tree of Kubernetes can be divided into three independent group types:
- Core group (**/api/v1**)
- This group includes objects such as Pods, Services, Nodes, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.
- Named group
  This group includes objects in **/apis/$NAME/$VERSION** format. These different API versions imply different levels of stability and support:
  - ***Alpha level*** - it may be dropped at any point in time, without notice. For example, **/apis/batch/v2alpha1**
  - **Beta level*** - it is well-tested, but the semantics of objects may change in incompatible ways in a subsequent beta or stable release. For example, **/apis/certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1**
  -*** Stable level*** - appears in released software for many subsequent versions. For example, **/apis/networking.k8s.io/v1**
- System-wide
  This group consists of system-wide API endpoints, like **/healthz**, **/logs**, **/metrics**, **/ui**, etc.
- **Note:** Use ***kubectl get --raw /api/v1*** to see all options (start at / then path)
