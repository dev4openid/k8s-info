- A control plane node runs the following essential control plane components and agents:
	- API Server
	- Scheduler
	- Controller Managers
	- Key-Value Data Store (etcd)
	- In addition, the control plane node runs:
		- Container Runtime
		- Node Agent
		- Proxy
		- Optional add-ons for cluster-level monitoring and logging
# Worker Node Components
- A worker node has the following components:
	- Container Runtime
	- Node Agent - kubelet

	- Add-ons for DNS, Dashboard user interface, cluster-level monitoring and logging
# Worker Node Components: Container Runtime
- Kubernetes supports several container runtimes:

- **Container Runtime Interface**
- (Retrieved from [blog.kubernetes.io](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/12/container-runtime-interface-cri-in-kubernetes.html))
- two services:
	- **ImageService** is responsible for all the image-related operations
	- **RuntimeService** is responsible for all the Pod and container-related operations

# Worker Node Components: Proxy - kube-proxy
- The **kube-proxy** is the network agent which runs on each node
- The kube-proxy is responsible for TCP, UDP, and SCTP stream forwarding or random forwarding across a set of Pod backends of an application, and it implements forwarding rules defined by users through Service API objects
# Worker Node Components: Add-ons
- **DNS** Cluster DNS is a DNS server required to assign DNS records to Kubernetes objects and resources.
- **Dashboard** A general purpose web-based user interface for cluster management.
- **Monitoring** Collects cluster-level container metrics and saves them to a central data store.
- **Logging** Collects cluster-level container logs and saves them to a central log store for analysis

- # Networking Challenges
	- Container-to-Container communication inside Pods
	- Pod-to-Pod communication on the same node and across cluster nodes
	- Service-to-Pod communication within the same namespace and across cluster namespaces
	- External-to-Service communication for clients to access applications in a cluster
	  All these networking challenges must be addressed before deploying a Kubernetes cluster
- **Container-to-Container Communication Inside Pods**
	- isolated network space is referred to as a **network namespace**
	- Pod is started, a special infrastructure **Pause container** is initialized by the Container Runtime
- "**IP-per-Pod**" and ensures Pod-to-Pod communication
- **Pod-to-Pod Communication Across Nodes**
	- **localhost** - inside the Pod
	- Containers are integrated with the overall Kubernetes networking model through the use of the [Container Network Interface](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) (CNI) [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni#3rd-party-plugins) plugins are 3rd-party Software Defined Networking (SDN)
	- ![Container Network Interface (CNI)](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+1T2022+type@asset+block@Container_Network_Interface__CNI__Core_Plugins2023.png)**Container Network Interface (CNI) ****Core Plugins**
- e.g. CNIs [Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/), [Weave](https://www.weave.works/oss/net/), [Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/)
-
- **External-to-Pod Communication**
	- external accessibility through **Services**
	- complex encapsulations of network routing rule definitions stored in **iptables** on cluster nodes and implemented by **kube-proxy** agents
	- with the aid of **kube-proxy**, applications become accessible from outside the cluster over a virtual IP address and a dedicated port number

- # Kubernetes Configuration
- **All-in-One Single-Node Installation**
  In this setup, all the control plane and worker components are installed and running on a single-node. While it is useful for learning, development, and testing, it is not recommended for production purposes.
- **Single-Control Plane and Multi-Worker Installation**
  In this setup, we have a single-control plane node running a stacked etcd instance. Multiple worker nodes can be managed by the control plane node.
- **Single-Control Plane with Single-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation**
  In this setup, we have a single-control plane node with an external etcd instance. Multiple worker nodes can be managed by the control plane node.
- **Multi-Control Plane and Multi-Worker Installation**
  In this setup, we have multiple control plane nodes configured for High-Availability (HA), with each control plane node running a stacked etcd instance. The etcd instances are also configured in an HA etcd cluster and multiple worker nodes can be managed by the HA control plane.
- **Multi-Control Plane with Multi-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation**
  In this setup, we have multiple control plane nodes configured in HA mode, with each control plane node paired with an external etcd instance. The external etcd instances are also configured in an HA etcd cluster, and multiple worker nodes can be managed by the HA control plane. This is the most advanced cluster configuration recommended for production environments
